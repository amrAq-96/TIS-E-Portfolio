# Assignment 2 – Industry Talk (Poster)

## Description
This assignment documents my participation in an Industry Talk session where industry representatives shared insights about current IT practices and technologies used in real organizations. The session focused on topics such as digital transformation, enterprise systems, data analytics, and IT career pathways. The talk helped students understand how technology is applied in real working environments and how different IT roles support business operations.

## Reflection
Attending this Industry Talk gave me a clearer understanding of how companies use systems like SAP, data analytics, and digital platforms to manage their operations efficiently. I learned that IT roles are not limited to technical tasks only, but they also involve problem-solving, communication, and supporting business decisions. As a Network and Security student, this session motivated me to strengthen my technical foundation and better prepare myself for future industry challenges.
