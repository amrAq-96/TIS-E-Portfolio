# Assignment 3 – Academic Writing

## Description
This assignment is an academic writing report based on **Industry Talk 2**, which focused on **project management and system development** in the technology industry.  
The report discusses the speaker’s professional background, key responsibilities in the industry, and the essential skills required for computer science and IT students. Topics such as system development life cycle (SDLC), teamwork, communication skills, and planning were highlighted to show how academic knowledge is applied in real industrial environments.

## Reflection
Writing this academic report helped me better understand how **industry expectations align with what we learn at university**.  
I realized that technical knowledge alone is not enough; skills such as communication, teamwork, and project management are equally important. This assignment motivated me to improve my academic writing skills and to prepare myself better for future professional challenges in the IT industry.
